                <h3>The Computer</h3>
                <p>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.
                    Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs.

                <h3>Social Networks</h3>
                <p>The online world provides many opportunities to develop social and technical skills that teenagers need to function in today’s society.
                    Parents should talk to their children about appropriate media use and build an atmosphere where children are comfortable speaking with their parents about their problems.</p>

                <h3>IT Ecosystem</h3>
                <p>Classical approaches of computer science do not scale well for todays large and complex software-intensive systems.
                    Software systems cannot be considered in isolation.
