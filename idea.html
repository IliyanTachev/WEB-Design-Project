         When it comes to virtual reality, video gets all the glory.
         But hearing in VR—as bullets whiz overhead and floors creak underfoot—is just as key.
         Heavyweights like HTC and Oculus are working hard on their audio engines, but a San Diego startup is taking multidimensional sound a step further.
         Ossic’s X over-ear headphones adapt to a listener’s anatomy, creating the most convincing 3D audio effects yet.
         First, sensors at the top of the ear cups measure your head size to precisely time audio delays between the ears.
         Four drivers surround each ear, simulating sound that comes from multiple directions.
         Finally, the Ossic X’s built-in head tracking uses an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a compass to match what you’re hearing to your every move.
